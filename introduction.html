			<li>Personal background:  I’m 23. I was born in South Carolina but raised almost entirely in North Carolina. I spend 
			basically all of my time with my wife in one way or another, and I love her very much.</li>
			<li>Academic background:  I finished high school in 2016 and attended a couple years at UNCW before dropping out. 
			Eventually I decided to go back to school but this time at CPCC.</li>
			<li>Background in this subject:  Very little beyond an AP course in high school and some computer science courses at 
			UNCW, but it is the only subject I’ve really been passionate about so far.</li>
			<li>Primary Computer Platform:  Windows 10</li>
			<li>Courses I'm Taking & Why: I’m taking all of these because they’re requirements for my degree.</li>
